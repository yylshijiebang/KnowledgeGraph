1201  Laparoscopy showed Meckel's diverticulum with a mass of 3Ã—2.
1202  Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum with gastric heterotopia and showed a proliferation of spindle cells in a myxoid background, with an inflammatory infiltrate made of lymphocytes and plasmocytes.
1203 CONCLUSION: While perforation of a Meckel diverticulum with gastric heterotopia is a common finding, the discovery of an inflammatory pseudotumor following a perforation is rare; the differential diagnosis should include Burkitt's lymphoma.

1592 RESULTS: 11 patients out of 137 (8,02%) had an appendectomy before the development of Crohn's disease.
1593  An average age in which the appendectomy took place and the development of Crohn's disease was diagnosed 14 (5-20 years), having 90% of the patients diagnosed in the early post-surgical stages.
1594  The initial anatomopathologic diagnosis and the histological re evaluation agreed in just one case, compatible with Crohn's disease.
1595 CONCLUSION: The majority of appendectomies carried out in paediatric patients that later develop Crohn's disease are realized by a bias diagnosis of acute appendicitis and the relation between the two of them can be explained as the not yet developed Crohn's disease at the moment of the appendectomy.
1596  Appendectomies at a paediatric age are not associated with a potential development of Crohn's disease.

2144 Author information: (1)MGH Crohn's and Colitis Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.
2145 BACKGROUND: The relationship between appendectomy and Crohn's disease is controversial.
2146  A Swedish-Danish cohort study was conducted to assess the risk of developing Crohn's disease after an appendectomy.
2147 METHODS: 709 353 appendectomy patients in Sweden (since 1964) and Denmark (since 1977) were followed for first hospitalisations for Crohn's disease to 2004.
2148 RESULTS: Overall, 1655 Crohn's disease cases were observed during 11.
2149  Whereas appendectomy before the age of 10 years was not associated with the risk of Crohn's disease (SIR 1.
2150 25), the overall SIR of developing Crohn's disease was 1.
2151  SIR diminished rapidly thereafter, with the risk of Crohn's disease reaching background levels after 5-10 years for Crohn's disease overall, as well as for Crohn's ileitis, ileocolonic Crohn's disease, Crohn's colitis and other/unspecified Crohn's disease.
2152  A long-term increased risk of Crohn's disease up to 20 years after the appendectomy was seen only in appendectomy patients without appendicitis or mesenteric lymphadenitis.
2153 CONCLUSION: The transient increased risk of Crohn's disease after an appendectomy is probably explained by diagnostic bias.
2154 Postoperative pain and need for analgesia were less in the TA group than in the OA (difference did not reach significance).
2155 There were 2 cases of laparoscopic mesh repair (for posterolateral diaphragmatic Bochdalek hernia and laparoscopic Heller cardiomyotomy) and 1 laparoscopic cystectomy for torsion of an ovarian cyst; 7 laparoscopic appendectomies (6 for acute appendicitis and 1 for perforated appendix); and 9 laparoscopic cholecystectomies (8 for acute cholecystitis and 1 for gallbladder empyema).

2453 Card15 gene overexpression in mononuclear and epithelial cells of the inflamed Crohn's disease colon.
2454 fr BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is one of the principal human chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
2455  CARD15 is the first susceptibility gene implicated in the predisposition to Crohn's disease and is known to be expressed only in monocytes.
2456 AIMS: To analyse the tissue distribution of CARD15 and identify cells producing CARD15 in samples of colon from patients with Crohn's disease and control subjects.
2457 PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed CARD15 gene expression in surgical specimens of colon from eight children with Crohn's disease and nine controls by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridisation, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
2458  Increased CARD15 expression was detected in Crohn's disease lesions.
2459  There were more CARD15 positive cells in Crohn's disease lesions than in uninvolved areas.
2460  Both intestinal epithelial cells, macrophages, and their derivatives overproduced CARD15 in Crohn's disease.
2461  To further assess CARD15 expression by intestinal epithelial cells, we performed RT-PCR on freshly isolated intestinal epithelial cells, and showed that these cells isolated from Crohn's disease samples contained more CARD15 mRNA than intestinal epithelial cells from controls.
2462 CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that colonic involvement in active Crohn's disease is associated with increased CARD15 gene expression in both macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells.

2486 Sonographic findings of Meckel's diverticulitis in children.
2487 OBJECTIVE: We know of only one previous study that has described the sonographic appearances of the inflamed Meckel's diverticulum in several cases (nine patients).
2488  Our study reviews sonographic, clinical, and pathologic findings in 10 patients with an inflamed Meckel's diverticulum.
2489 CONCLUSION: Sonographic findings of an inflamed Meckel's diverticulum may mimic findings for acute appendicitis or intestinal duplication.
2490  In patients with rectal bleeding due to diverticulitis, the visualization of a tubular hyperechoic structure on sonography is suggestive of Meckel's diverticulum.
2491  The inflamed Meckel's diverticulum may present as a cyst, but its mucosal layer is more irregular than that found in an intestinal duplication.
2492  We found that routine color Doppler sonography revealed anomalous vessels and signs of inflammation on the wall of the Meckel's diverticulum.

2500 RESULTS: An increased risk of Crohn's disease was found for more than 20 years after appendectomy, with incidence rate ratio 2.
2501  Crohn's disease patients with a history of perforated appendicitis had a worse prognosis.
2502 CONCLUSIONS: Appendectomy is associated with an increased risk of Crohn's disease that is dependent on the patient's sex, age, and the diagnosis at operation.

2611 MATERIAL AND METHODS: The material consisted of 71 patients with Meckel's diverticulum treated in our hospital during the years 1988-1998.
2612  At the same eleven-year study period Meckel's diverticulum was found during 55 out of 3758 appendicectomies (1.
2613  Eight patients had intestinal occlusion, five patients had Meckel's diverticulitis, two patients had invagination, and in one case a sharp piece of plastic material had perforated the Meckel's diverticulum.
2614 CONCLUSION: Meckel's diverticulum should be searched in the laparotomy due to acute abdomen.

2642 [Meckel's diverticulum.
2643 BACKGROUND: The paper aimed to highlight the percentage presence of Meckel's diverticulum compared to appendiceal pathology in a retrospective study and whether its surgical removal is always useful, even if asymptomatic.
2644  The presence of Meckel's diverticulum was rarely diagnosed in preoperative patients; it was occasionally found in both elective surgery in patients with other abdominal pathologies, above all appendicitis, and in patients undergoing emergency surgery for acute pathologies (occlusion, peritonitis) caused by the former.
2645 CONCLUSIONS: We are convinced that Meckel's diverticulum should be investigated as a matter of course during appendectomy and, where present, it should be removed even if asymptomatic because the problems arising secondary to complications are undoubtedly more severe compared to any discomfort following its surgical removal.
2646 BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency presenting in the pediatric population.

2790 The role of Peyer's patches in the age-related incidence of Crohn's disease.
2791 Recently researchers have suggested that clinical subsets of Crohn's disease occur, which are variously described as inflammatory, fibrostenotic, and fistulizing.
2792  The lesions of Crohn's disease occur in segments that suggest that distribution of Peyer's patches.
2793  When the age-related incidence of Crohn's disease was plotted for all countries from which such data were available, the peaks of greatest case frequency occurred at ages 15 to 25 years and paralleled a similar peak representing the number of Peyer's patches as a function of age.
2794  This correlation suggests that Crohn's disease may develop as an inflammatory process specifically targeting these important lymphoid structures.

3582 Acute abdominal pain in children.
3583 Acute abdominal pain in children is a common and challenging problem for the family physician.
3584  Pain, diarrhea, and weight loss were clinical findings in half the patients; anemia, leukocytosis, electrolyte disturbances and hypoalbuminemia were common laboratory findings.
3585 [Mesenteric lymphadenitis (author's transl)].
3586  Abdominal pain, often severe enough to require differentiation from acute appendicitis, emerged as a dominant symptom, especially in older children.
3587  Respiratory symptoms were often insignificant, although the lower respiratory tract was sometimes involved.
3588  Ascending cholangitis was the most common etiologic factor throught this series, although malignant extrahepatic obstruction has become more prevalent in recent years.

3594 The relationship and epidemiology of acute terminal ileitis and Crohn's disease.
3595 The frequency of admission for acute terminal ileitis, Crohn's disease, and acute mesenteric lymphadenitis has been compared from the years 1951 to 1970, and the long-term results of operation for acute terminal ileitis in 1951-1965 have been examined.
3596  Whereas the admission rates for both acute terminal ileitis and Crohn's disease rose during the review period, that for acute lymphadenitis tended to fall slightly.
3597  One of these, with small intestinal stenosis at the initial operation, proved to have histological evidence of Crohn's disease, and a further nine have since developed unequivocal evidence of the disease.
3598  It is concluded that appendicectomy can safely be performed in acute terminal ileitis provided that the caecum is not inflamed and that Crohn's disease seldom develops as a sequel.

6273 Barrett's oesophagus: treatment with surgery.
6274 Barrett's oesophagus develops as a consequence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and may progress to oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
6275  Antireflux surgery is an option for patients with reflux disease, but the efficacy and impact on the natural history of disease in patients with Barrett's oesophagus is controversial.
6276 Acid suppression and surgical therapy for Barrett's oesophagus.
6277 Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is a common medical problem in developed countries, and is a risk factor for the development of Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
6278  Both proton pump inhibitor therapy and antireflux surgery are effective at controlling endoscopic signs and symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux in patients with Barrett's oesophagus, but often fail to eliminate pathological oesophageal acid exposure.
6279  The current available studies strongly suggest that acid suppressive therapy, both pharmacological as well as surgical acid suppression, can reduce the risk the development and progression in patients with Barrett's oesophagus, but are not capable of complete prevention.
6280 Mechanisms of Barrett's oesophagus (clinical): LOS dysfunction, hiatal hernia, peristaltic defects.
6281 Barrett's oesophagus, with the potential to develop into oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC), is a major complication of gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GORD).
6282  Further, although excess oesophageal acid exposure plays a major role in the genesis of long-segment Barrett's oesophagus there is minimal evidence supporting this for short-segment Barrett's.
6283 Mechanisms of Barrett's oesophagus: intestinal differentiation, stem cells, and tissue models.
6284 Barrett's oesophagus (BE) is defined as any metaplastic columnar epithelium in the distal oesophagus which replaces normal squamous epithelium and which predisposes to cancer development.

6296 Obesity is a major public health issue as it is related to several chronic disorders, including type-2 diabetes, high blood pressure, dyslipemia, cardiovascular diseases and cancer, among others.
6297  Among these are a few entities such as enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma or immunoproliferative small intestinal disease that, essentially, do not arise elsewhere than in the gastrointestinal tract.
6298 Crohn's disease may involve any part of the digestive tract from mouth to anus, but affects mainly the distal ileum and the,colon.
6299  The risk of colectomy in ulcerative colitis is about 1% per year Dysplasia and cancer may complicate longstanding extensive colonic lesions in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
6300  Malignant transformation of chronic inflammatory lesions may also occur in patients with longstanding lesions of the small bowel in Crohn's disease.
6301  This device is invaluable in the investigation of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB), occult bleeding with iron deficiency anaemia, small bowel Crohn's disease (CD), small bowel neoplasms and other mucosal disorders.

6303  In this review, we address some of the areas that present particular problems in small bowel Crohn's disease.
6304 RECENT FINDINGS: A key issue specific to small bowel Crohn's disease relates to its diagnosis given that access to the small bowel is limited.
6305  In addition, our ability to differentiate small bowel Crohn's disease from other causes of inflammation, such as tuberculosis, is improving on the basis of better understanding of the features that differentiate these conditions.
6306  It is also becoming apparent that jejunal Crohn's disease represents a distinct disease phenotype with potentially worse clinical outcomes.
6307  Finally, because it is a rare complication, our understanding of small bowel cancer associated with Crohn's disease remains limited.
6308 SUMMARY: Although small bowel Crohn's disease presents specific management issues not seen in patients with Crohn's disease elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract, our knowledge of how to manage these is improving.
6309 Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) include both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and both diseases are marked by inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract.

6317 Surgical pathologists frequently encounter biopsies in patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE), defined as replacement of the normal stratified squamous epithelium of the distal esophagus by metaplastic columnar epithelium containing goblet cells.
6318 Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is an underappreciated complication of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) that can affect the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and liver.
6319 IMPORTANCE: Basal cell adenocarcinoma (BCAC) of the minor salivary gland is an extremely rare disease: the most recent substantive literature review reports only 25 cases.
6320  Based on biopsy findings from an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy examination, a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), non-GC type, was made.

6324 Portal vein thrombosis: what is new?
6325 Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is one of the most common vascular disorders of the liver with significant morbidity and mortality.
6326  Moreover it is commonly assumed that curcumin has also been suggested as a remedy for digestive diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), a chronic immune disorder affecting the gastrointestinal tract and that can be divided in two major subgroups: Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), depending mainly on the intestine tract affected by the inflammatory events.
6327  VCE is now a first-line procedure for exploring the small bowel in cases of obscure digestive bleeding and is also indicated in some patients with Crohn's disease, celiac disease, and polyposis syndrome.
6328  A video capsule has also been designed for visualizing the esophagus in order to detect Barrett's esophagus or esophageal varices.
6329  The outcome was evaluated using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and the Female Sexual Function Index.

6333  In order for CTC to be used appropriately, contraindications such as acute abdominal conditions (diverticulitis or the acute phase of inflammatory bowel diseases) and surveillance in patients with a long-standing history of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease and in those with hereditary colonic syndromes should not be overlooked.
6334 Infection confined to the antral mucosa protects against gastric cancer but predisposes to duodenal ulcer, whereas Hp infection of the oxyntic mucosa increases the risk of gastric cancer.
6335  Low concentration of free circulating citrulline signifies severe intestinal mucosal damage in humans with nonmalignant disorders, such as villous atrophy-associated diseases, short bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, and is used in follow-up after small bowel transplantation.
6336  Apart from short-term application, maintenance therapy with PPIs is recommended and increasingly used in certain diseases, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, especially for people with erosive oesophagitis or Barrett's oesophagus.
6337 For example, macrophages and osteoclasts lacking Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) are not able to form podosomes, and this leads to altered macrophage chemotaxis and defective bone resorption by osteoclasts.

6345 Sarcoidosis occurring after lymphoma: report of 14 patients and review of the literature.
6346 Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease that most frequently affects the lungs with pulmonary infiltrates and/or bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
6347  Sarcoidosis was of mild intensity or self-healing in most cases, and overall clinical response to sarcoidosis was excellent with complete clinical response in 91% of patients.
6348  Sarcoidosis was identified after a follow-up computerized tomography scan (CT-scan) or fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (FDG-PET/CT) evaluation in 18/34 patients (53%).
6349  Sarcoidosis is therefore a differential diagnosis to consider when lymphoma relapse is suspected on a CT-scan or FDG-PET/CT, emphasizing the necessity to rely on histological confirmation of lymphoma relapse.
6350  Obesity is known to be associated with chronic low grade inflammation, but no reason for this association has been offered in the past.
6351  Obese individuals show a decrease in the concentration of Akkermansia muciniphila in the mucus that lines the intestinal wall, resulting in thinner mucus and a weakened intestinal lining and permitting metabolic endotoxins formed by other bacterial flora like LPS to enter the blood steam and cause the chronic inflammation associated with obesity.

6430 Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract and is caused by incomplete obliteration of the vitelline duct during intrauterine life.
6431  Esophageal adenocarcinoma arises from a sequential gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) spectrum from reflux erosive esophagitis, to Barrett's esophagus, and finally to esophageal adenocarcinoma.
6432  This diffusion results in disruption of the epithelial barrier function, exacerbation of inflammation, acceleration of columnar transformation in the esophagus (Barrett's esophagus) via the induction of caudal-type homeobox 2, and the shifting of carcinogenic N-nitroso compound formation from the luminal to epithelial compartment.

6617 Barrett's esophagus: the American perspective.
6618 com The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) defines Barrett's esophagus as the condition in which any extent of metaplastic columnar epithelium that predisposes to cancer development replaces the squamous epithelium that normally lines the distal esophagus.
6619  Although cardiac mucosa may be metaplastic, its malignant predisposition is not clear, and the AGA still requires the demonstration of intestinal metaplasia (with goblet cells) for a diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus.
6620  Endoscopic therapy is often curative for mucosal neoplasms in Barrett's esophagus because the risk of lymph node metastases is only 1-2%.
6621  The management of low-grade dysplasia is disputed because of poor agreement among pathologists on the diagnosis and because of contradictory data on the natural history, but the AGA recommends that radiofrequency ablation (RFA) should be a therapeutic option for patients with confirmed low-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus.
6622 INTRODUCTION: Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) represent a chronic inflammatory condition of the bowel that often require lifelong medical therapy for the induction and maintenance of the remission.

6750 Ablation of Barrett's oesophagus: towards improved outcomes for oesophageal cancer?
6751 au Barrett's oesophagus is the major risk factor for the development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma.
6752  The management of Barrett's oesophagus entails treating reflux symptoms with acid-suppressing medication or surgery (fundoplication).
6753  Patients with Barrett's oesophagus usually undergo endoscopic surveillance, which aims to identify dysplastic changes or cancer at its earliest stage, when treatment outcomes should be better.
6754  Alternative endoscopic interventions are now available and are suggested for the treatment of early cancer and prevention of progression of Barrett's oesophagus to cancer.
6755  Radiofrequency ablation of dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus might reduce the risk of cancer progression, although cancer development has been reported after this treatment.
6756  The new endoscopic interventions for Barrett's oesophagus and early oesophageal cancer have the potential to improve clinical outcomes, although evidence that confirms superiority over oesphagectomy is limited.

7171 Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, a severe bilateral granulomatous intraocular inflammation associated with serous retinal detachments, disk edema, and vitritis, with eventual development of a sunset glow fundus, is an autoimmune inflammatory condition mediated by TÂ cells that target melanocytes in individuals susceptible to the disease.
7172  Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease presents clinically in 4 different phases: prodromal, uveitic, convalescent, and recurrent, with extraocular manifestations including headache, meningismus, hearing loss, poliosis, and vitiligo, to varying degrees.
7173  Ocular coherence tomography has replaced other imaging modalities in the diagnosis of acute and chronic Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease by revealing exudative detachments of the retina in the acute stage, along with choroidal thickening and demonstrating choroidal thinning in the chronic stage.
7174  Patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease can have good final outcomes if treated promptly and aggressively and thus avoid complications such as sunset glow fundus, cataracts, glaucoma, subretinal fibrosis, and choroidal neovascularization.

8603 OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of the nonvalved double-plate Molteno implant with two valved implants, the Krupin Eye Valve with Disc and the Ahmed Glaucoma Valve, in the treatment of recalcitrant glaucoma.
8604 PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors performed a nonrandomized retrospective review of patients who received the Molteno implant (n = 27), Krupin Eye Valve with Disc (n = 13), or Ahmed Glaucoma Valve (n = 13), with adjunctive mitomycin C.
8605 RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis showed that the Molteno implant patients were more likely to maintain an intraocular pressure between 5 and 15 mm Hg than Ahmed Glaucoma Valve patients (P = 0.
8606  Success rates at 1 year were 80% (95% CI, 66-97%) for the Molteno implant, 39% (19-77%) for the Krupin Eye Valve with Disc, and 35% (15-82%) for the Ahmed Glaucoma Valve.
8607  However, Ahmed Glaucoma Valve patients were less likely to experience complications requiring reoperation or loss of two or more lines of visual acuity (P < 0.
8608 CONCLUSIONS: This nonrandomized study suggests that the Molteno implant with mitomycin C is more likely to result in intraocular pressures in the lower teens than the Ahmed Glaucoma Valve with mitomycin C.

8644 Review article: the limitations of corticosteroid therapy in Crohn's disease.
8645 be Corticosteroids are highly effective in inducing clinical remission in patients with active Crohn's disease.
8646  To minimize the risk of toxicity, corticosteroids are increasingly recommended for short-term use only at the lowest effective dose to induce remission in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.
8647  Corticosteroid formulations with low systemic bioavailability, such as controlled-release budesonide, may be associated with a lower rate of dermatologic adverse effects but appear to be somewhat less effective than conventional corticosteroids in inducing remission in patients with active Crohn's disease.

15756 INTRODUCTION: Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type of glaucoma, pathogenesis of which is not completely known.
15757  Corneal decompensation as a result of possible endothelial toxicity of high-molecular weight sodium hyaluronate as well as spontaneous absorption seem possible.
15758 PATIENTS AND METHODS: The tests were carried out in subjects of the Erlangen Glaucoma registry: Normals, patients with ocular hypertension, and patients with open-angle glaucoma without or with field defects.
15759  Glaucoma was diagnosed in people with an excavated optic neuropathy and a reproducible visual field defect or on the basis of severe structural disc abnormality alone, if reliable field results could not be obtained.
15760  Glaucoma was the leading cause of blindness.
15761  Primary angle-closure glaucoma and secondary glaucoma were the most visually destructive forms of the disease.
15762 Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is the second most common cause of blindness in developed countries.
15763 OBJECTIVES: Glaucoma is a major cause of blindness.
15764  Juvenile open-angle glaucoma was a logical starting point in the search for genetic causes of open-angle glaucoma: it shows a strong autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern, occurs at an early age, demonstrates obvious phenotypic signs (dramatic elevation of intraocular pressure and subsequent optic nerve damage), and is likely to be found in multiple generations as parents of affected children are still living.
